# Project 2 - What's My Life!?

## Description
This application prompts the user to take a 20-question personality quiz. The user receives personalized results including their Myers Briggs Indicator Type (4-letter acronym), a detailed description of the specific type, and six fun facts. The user is also prompted to create a username and password in order to sign in and view their results at any time.

## Project Details
Motivation for Development - We saw this as a challenging and creative concept with lots of room for future development. 

User Story - The user is introspective, light-hearted and enjoys learning more about how different people perceive the  world.
